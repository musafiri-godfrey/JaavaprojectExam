1.PLANNING
  Due to different difficulties we conducted from different women ,we saw that there is a problem of getting to know how the babies in their womb are doing ,that’s when we come up with the idea of PREGNANT WOMEN INFORMATION SYSTEM which will also direct them how to keep those babies healthy in their womb .
This systemalso will guide the pregnant women for problems being happen to them in every week , it means the system will provide the useful information from 1st week of pregnancy to 40th week of pregnancy .
This program will solve the problem of time spent in movements made by pregnancy women to hospital 
Users will be able to ask questions through email,mobile  phone (sms,calls) whenever they are and the doctor will respond that.

2.DESIGN .
The software includes two external entities; user,admin/doctor.
This software will firstily require the user to create an account (username,password,email) it will also asks for other useful information ,after account creation user will be  directed to home page to acces the information of pregnancy from 1st week to 40th week .
The account holder will use that information due to her situation ,if there is some inconvenience to her situation ,she will inform directly the doctor /admin through contacts listed in footer, and doctor will respond and recommend directly the user special treatment .
Admin will also have an account with required credentials where he/she will get the control of every action taking place ,Admin will be able to delete ,update user’s information and will also respond to the questions questioned by users.

3.DEVELOPMENT 
    Front end technology 
This front end technology is the part of website that the user interacts with directly, it includes everything that users experience directly text colors and styles ,image,graphs and tables ,buttons colors and navigation menu .Java script,html, and css are the languages that we used in front end development 
HTML; stands for hypertext markup language , it’s use is to design the froat end portion of webpages using markup language .it is a combination of hypertext and markup language and hypertext defines the link between webpage.
CSS;it standsfor cascading styles sheets ,it is designed by language intended to make easier the processof making webpage presentable ,we used it to put styles to web page.

JAVA SCRIPT; Is used to create magic on site to make the user interactive with the site .it was used to enhance the functionality of website to run web based software .we used it for both front end and back end .

Front -end- Frameworks and libraries ;
We used com.mysql.sdbc.5.1.5.  as library handling my-sql connection with the system .
Back end developer 
Backend is server side of the website it stores and arranges data and also makes sure if every thing on client side of website works well . here we used jsp and servlet technologies to perfom activities like writing apls, creating libraliesand working with system components without user interface or even systems of scientific programming and ciud operations (create read update delete)

Storage and database 
We used MYSQL database management system to store  da from back end operations 
Other technologies we used in our project is xzammp as server, MYSQL as database and Eclipse as IDE.

4. TESTING

Testing enables teams to identify and address potential problems before they affect users. We followed six key phases of the software testing lifecycle:

1. Requirement analysis
During this phase, we maped the environments in which the software will run and determine who will use the app. We considered any possible outcome that can occur, both immediately and in the future.
2. Test planning
Here is when we thought about what's needed to complete the test and meet objectives. We considered the following:
•	what is needed to test an application that's running in Pregnancy information 
•	If it's necessary to test how the application will scale; 
•	how many users can access the application before it scales; and 
•	how many resources the application has before scaling out,….
3. Test case development
After planning our tests -- and what we will test -- we determined the technical details for each test case. For example, if it is necessary to deploy an application to pregnancy to test it, we needed pregnancy manifest and some automation scripts to get the application up and running.
4. Test environment setup
In this stage of the software testing lifecycle, we identified where the tests will run. For example, Rwandan population is needed to perform testing, we implemented one of the several options to deploy one which is Huye district population.
5. Test execution
We have shared access to the testing environment and associated code. Contrastingly, it's not a best practice for team members to all store code on our local computers.
6. Test reporting
Without reports, tests aren't entirely helpful. We used test report to understand if an application works as expected.
5.Deployment

•	we Adopted Continuous Delivery
•	we used an automated Software Deployment Process
•	we Create a Checklist for Deployment
•	we Made a Backup Plan
•	Selected the Most Appropriate Deployment Method by implementing software that is simple to integrate with other tools and existing local applications.
•	Used a Continuous Integration Serve. This ensures that the generated application will run on a developer's system, as well as avoid "integration hell."
